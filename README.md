# Hi! 👋

My name is Juan Manuel. I'm a video editor looking my way to be a
developer.

## About me

- 🇦🇷 I live in Argentina
- 🎬 I am also a video editor
  - Using tools like `Adobe Premiere Pro` and `Adobe After Effects`
  - 🏃 Yes, I can do 2D animations
  - 🧨 And Visual Effects too!

I started coding with **PHP**, then I move to **Javascript** and
**NodeJS**. But I keep learning a lot of stuff! 

## Learning

I am a self-taught person. A day without learning something it is a bad
one.

Now I am learning:
