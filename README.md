# Hi! 👋

My name is Juan Manuel, I am always learning and making things!

I am a FullStack Web Developer using **JavaScript** with **NodeJS** but I am
currently learning really cool stuff with linux containerization and
compiled languages like **Go Lang** and **Java**.

  - 🏃 Yes, I can do 2D animations
  - 🧨 And Visual Effects too!

My journey as developer started with an old computer and a friend
showing me how he made a for loop from 1 to 10 with C. That seemed like
magic for me! ✨👈

My goals with coding is to solve problems and to have fun!
